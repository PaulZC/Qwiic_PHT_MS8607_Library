  basically do whatever you want with this code.

  The original library and example code was written by TEConnectivity,
  the company that made the sensor. Way to go TE! May other companies
  learn from you.

  Feel like supporting open source hardware?
  Buy a board from SparkFun!

  This example is used to test production units.
