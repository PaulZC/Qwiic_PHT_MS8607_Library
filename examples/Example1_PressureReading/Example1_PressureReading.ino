  basically do whatever you want with this code.

  The original library and example code was written by TEConnectivity,
  the company that made the sensor. Way to go TE! May other companies
  learn from you.

  Feel like supporting open source hardware?
  Buy a board from SparkFun!

  This example prints the current pressure in hPa and temperature in C.
